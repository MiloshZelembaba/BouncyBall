Physics Emulator
=======================

Two ways to run: ~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) It's an IntelliJ project, so load it up in IntelliJ and then just run it
2) (doesn't work right now) 'cd src' and then 'make run'




How to Use: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click anywhere on the canvas that pops up to create a circle. This circle will start
falling and bouncing around. By pressing 'p', it'll pause the simultaor and
another window will pop up prompting you to select an object. Select one of the 
circles and you can then change its properties in the new window. Press 'p' to 
start the simulator again.
